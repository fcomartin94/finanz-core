## 1. Current actual status

Current functional status:

- Operational app with local Room storage.
- Simplified form for registration of movements.
- Modernized UI (Material 3, gradients, KPI cards, income/expense differentiation).
- Inset settings for real devices (system bars and keyboard).

Persistence:

- Local database: `finanzapp_db` (Room / SQLite).

---

## 2. Functional vision

The app allows:

- Register movements (income or expense) with:
- description
- amount
- guy
- See total balance.
- View balance for the current month.
- View movement history.
- See monthly summary with:
- income
- bills
- balance
- expense/income ratio
- recent movements
- Delete movements from history.

Important:

- Category and limit are no longer captured in UI.
- Internally the default category (`General`) is saved for domain compatibility.

```

Data flow:

`UI (Compose) -> ViewModel -> BudgetService -> Repository -> DAO -> Room`

Key points:

- `FinanzApp` creates DB and repository (simple manual injection).
- `BudgetViewModel` exposes `StateFlow<UiState>`.
- `Dao.getAll()` returns `Flow<List<Transaction>>` for reactive UI.

---

## 5. Data model and persistence

### Primary entity `Transaction`

- `id:Long`
- `description: String`
- `amount: Double`
- `type:TransactionType`
- `date: LocalDate`
- `category: Category` (`@Embedded(prefix = "cat_")`)

### Category

Although the UI does not ask for a category/limit, the model preserves it:

- `name: String`
- `budgetLimit: Double`

In registrations from UI:

- `name="General"`
- `budgetLimit = 0.0`

This maintains domain compatibility with other versions of the repository.

###DAO

- Complete list (Flow) ordered by descending date.
- Filter by type.
- Filter by date range.
- Insertion and deletion by ID.

---

## 6. Navigation and screens

Paths in `FinanzAppNavHost.kt`:

- `home`
- `transactions`
- `summary`

###Home

- Main card with available balance.
- KPI for balance of the month and number of movements.
- Empty state when there are no movements.
- Quick access to Transactions and Summary.

### Transactions

- Simplified form:
- description
- amount
- Income/Expense chip
- "Save movement" button.
- History with strong visual differentiation:
- `INCOME` or `EXPENSE` chip
- card color
- color sidebar
- sign in amount (`+` / `-`)
- Deletion action per item.

### Summary

- Monthly header.
- Income and expense KPI.
- Balance of the month.
- Indicator of proportion of expenditure on income.
- List of recent movements of the month.

---

## 7. User manual

### 7.1 Register a movement

1. Open `Transactions`.
2. Complete:
- description
- amount (> 0)
- type (Income/Expense)
3. Press `Save movement`.

### 7.2 Check financial health

1. In 'Home' check total balance and balance for the month.
2. In `Summary` review:
- income
- bills
- balance
- expense ratio

### 7.3 Correct data

- In `Transactions`, delete transactions with the trash can icon.

---

## 8. Responsive behavior and UI

The app uses:

- `Scaffold` with `WindowInsets.safeDrawing`.
- `navigationBarsPadding()` and `imePadding()`.
- `LazyColumn` / `verticalScroll` depending on the screen.

Aim:

- avoid clipping on real devices
- keep content and actions accessible with open keyboard

UI/Theme:

- Material 3 with dynamic scheme (Android 12+).
- Custom fallback palette.
- Global rounded `Shapes`.
- Smooth gradient backgrounds and raised cards.

---

## 9. Compilation and installation

### Requirements

- Current Android Studio.
- JDK 17 for stable build with AGP/Kotlin of this project.

### Run from Android Studio

1. Open `finanz-app` folder.
2. Sync Gradle.
3. Run `app` configuration.

### Generate debug APK

```bash
cd finanz-app
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Expected APK:

- `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

Installation by ADB:

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

---

## 10. Current limitations

- There is no editing of transactions (only registration and deletion).
- There are no advanced filters in history.
- There is no data export.
- There is no cloud synchronization (local offline).
- Amount format not completely homogeneous in all views (`€` and `EUR` coexist).

---

## 11. Relationship with `finanz-core` and `finanz-api`

- Shares base financial domain with both implementations.
- Android prioritizes simplified UX capture.
- Finanz API (`finanz-api/`) incorporates simplified endpoint equivalent.
- `finanz-core` retains educational CLI approach (currently with pending bugs in code).

---

## 12. Recommended roadmap

- Homogenize monetary format throughout the UI.
- Add filters by date/type in history.
- Incorporate movement editing.
- Export/import data.
- Improve form validations (inline messages).
- Prepare UI/instrumented testing.
